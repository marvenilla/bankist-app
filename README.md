# Bankist App

The Bankist App is a virtual banking application designed to simulate essential banking operations such as account management, money transfers, loan requests, and account closures. This project serves as a practical implementation of concepts taught in "The Complete JavaScript Course 2024: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy.

## Features

- **Login System**: Secure login with a PIN, handling user authentication to access personal banking details.
- **Transaction Management**: View transaction history, transfer funds to other users, and manage financial movements dynamically.
- **Loan Functionality**: Users can request loans based on specific criteria (e.g., having deposits that are at least 10% of the requested loan amount).
- **Account Closure**: Allows users to close their accounts after verifying their credentials.
- **Dynamic UI Updates**: The interface updates in real-time to reflect changes in the user's account, enhancing user interaction.
- **Sorting Transactions**: Users can sort their transaction history in ascending or descending order.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Structures the web application.
- **CSS** - Styles the application to improve usability and visual appeal.
- **JavaScript** - Adds interactivity and handles data manipulation and DOM events.
